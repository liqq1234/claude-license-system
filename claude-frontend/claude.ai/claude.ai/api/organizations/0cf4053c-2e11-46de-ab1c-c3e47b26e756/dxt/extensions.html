Open your Figma application.\n2. Open a Figma design file.\n3. Access the Dev Mode inspect panel, where you'll find the MCP Server configuration options.\n\n**Authentication:** The Dev Mode MCP server handles authentication through the Figma desktop application.

Acting as an MCP server bridges the gap between LLMs and the Windows operating system, allowing agents to perform tasks such as **file navigation, application control, UI interaction, QA testing,** and more.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Seamless Windows Integration**: Interacts natively with Windows UI elements, opens apps, controls windows, simulates user input, and more.\n- **Use Any LLM (Vision Optional)**: Unlike many automation tools, Windows MCP doesn't rely on any traditional computer vision techniques or specific fine-tuned models; it works with any LLMs, reducing complexity and setup time.\n- **Rich Toolset for UI Automation**: Includes tools for basic keyboard, mouse operation and capturing window/UI state.\n- **Lightweight & Open-Source**: Minimal dependencies and easy setup with full source code available under MIT license.\n- **Customizable & Extendable**: Easily adapt or extend tools to suit your unique automation or AI integration needs.\n- **Real-Time Interaction**: Typical latency between actions (e.g., from one mouse click to the next) ranges from **1.5 to 2.3 secs**, and may slightly vary based on the number of active applications and system load, also the inferencing speed of the llm.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### UV Package Manager\nThis MCP server requires [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager. \n\n```bash\npip install uv\n```\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, see the [UV documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)."},"size":9851956,"signature_info":{"status":"unsigned"}},{"id":"ant.dir.domdomegg.airtable-mcp-server","icon_url":"https://claude.ai/api/dxt/extensions/ant.dir.domdomegg.airtable-mcp-server/versions/1.5.0/icon.png","upload_date":"2025-07-23T16:07:21.968000+00:00","manifest":{"icon":"icon.png","name":"airtable-mcp-server","tools":[{"name":"list_records","description":"List records from a table"},{"name":"search_records","description":"Search for records containing specific text"},{"name":"list_bases","description":"List all accessible Airtable bases"},{"name":"list_tables","description":"List all tables in a specific base"},{"name":"describe_table","description":"Get detailed information about a specific table"},{"name":"get_record","description":"Get a specific record by ID"},{"name":"create_record","description":"Create a new record in a table"},{"name":"update_records","description":"Update up to 10 records in a table"},{"name":"delete_records","description":"Delete records from a table"},{"name":"create_table","description":"Create a new table in a base"},{"name":"update_table","description":"Update a table's name or description"},{"name":"create_field","description":"Create a new field in a table"},{"name":"update_field","description":"Update a field's name or description"}],"author":{"url":"https://github.com/domdomegg","name":"Adam Jones (domdomegg)"},"server":{"type":"node","mcp_config":{"env":{"AIRTABLE_API_KEY":"${user_config.api_key}"},"args":["${__dirname}/dist/index.js"],"command":"node"},"entry_point":"dist/index.js"},"license":"MIT","support":"https://github.com/domdomegg/airtable-mcp-server/issues","version":"1.5.0","homepage":"https://github.com/domdomegg/airtable-mcp-server","keywords":["airtable","database","mcp","api","automation","productivity"],"repository":{"url":"https://github.com/domdomegg/airtable-mcp-server.git","type":"git"},"description":"Read and write access to Airtable databases via the Model Context Protocol","dxt_version":"0.1","user_config":{"api_key":{"type":"string","title":"Airtable API Key","required":true,"sensitive":true,"description":"Your Airtable personal access token.
